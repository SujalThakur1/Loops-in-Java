PROJECT TITLE: File Operations in Java

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A Java program that performs various file operations, including reading from and writing to files, deciphering a file, processing numerical data in a text file, checking file existence and readability, storing a 2-D array in a file, and reading/writing objects from/to a file.
UTHOR: Sujal Thakur

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac Files.java
   java Files
FEATURES:

Option 1: Read from a file, write to a file, and copy a file.
Option 2: Decipher a file using a custom cipher.
Option 3: Process numerical data in a text file, calculate averages, and print results.
Option 4: Check if a file exists and can be read.
Option 5: Store a 2-D array in a file.
Option 6: Read and write objects from/to a file.
Option 0: Exit the program.
NOTES:

Ensure valid input for accurate results.
Follow on-screen instructions for each option.
For Option 1, provide a file name to read from and write to.
For Option 2, the program deciphers a file named "mystery.txt" and outputs the deciphered text to "deciphered.txt".
For Option 3, the program processes data in a file named "details.txt" and creates a copy named "detail copy file.txt".
For Option 4, enter a file name to check its existence and readability.
For Option 5, the program creates a file named "Array.txt" containing a 2-D array.
For Option 6, the program reads and writes objects to a file named "DVD.txt"

Follow on-screen instructions for each option.
Ensure valid input for accurate results.
For mathematical tables (Option 2), provide a lower and upper bound for the range of values.
For numerical analysis (Option 3), enter a series of numbers, and use '-1' to stop input.
Exit the program using Option 5.
